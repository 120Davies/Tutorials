# Streamlit 

![streamlit example gif](doc/streamlit_example.gif)

Streamlit is an open-source Python framework that allows you to create beautiful interactive websites for Machine Learning and Data Science projects without needing to have any web development skills.

It achieves this by allowing us to create a website by only adding a few Streamlit function calls to an existing python projects/experiments.

After adding the function calls Streamlit will display all the selected items and watch for any changes inside the script and update the website accordingly.

This repository contains the code for multiple of my Streamlit Applications. 

## Examples

* [Stock Price Dashboard](Examples/Stock-Price-Dashboard)

## Deploy your Streamlit Application with Heroku

Having created a beautiful dashboard is great but the reason for creating a dashboard is to show it to others. In order for others to be able to see your work you need to deploy your application. Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS), which allows you to deploy your Streamlit dashboard for free.
